						<h2 id="title1">Family Wedding</h2>
						<p id="body1">Our first reason for our trip to Charlotte was the wedding of our cousin. The long 11 hours drive was worth, once we see the bride and groom. It was such a glamorous wedding. We met all the extended family up there and enjoyed everything moment of it.The traditional food and service was so amazing. And all the songs were just more than I can explain. We were all so glad that we were able to witness this beautiful wedding. May God bless this young newly weds as they start their new home on that beautiful day.</p>

                    	<h2 id="title2">Billy Graham Library Visit</h2>
                    	<p id="body2">As we stayed few days after the wedding we managed to visit the big library of Billy Graham in Charlotte. I have always wanted to see it and I finally made it. The library visit is well organazed and interesting. Billy Graham was was an American evangelist, a prominent evangelical Christian figure, and an ordained Southern Baptist minister who became well known internationally. As a family we really enjoyed our visit to this historic place.</p>

                        <h2 id="title3">Hiking at South Mountain State Park</h2>
                        <p id="body3">I would say this was my ever first experience to hike. The extra time we got motivated us to see the Southern Mountain State Park. The place is kind of forest but attractive. Most of all the fountains are so impressive. As a family it was ideal place to spend at. We all made it to climb the top fountain up there. Everyone enjoyed the sight what nature brought us. We all had unforgetable moment.</p>
